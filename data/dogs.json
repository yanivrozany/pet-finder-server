The shelter staff think I am about 10 years old. I have been at the shelter since Nov 27, 2018.  Meet Toffee Puddin!  This handsome pup came to the shelter as a stray so staff and volunteers are still learning about him.  He has shared a kennel with other dogs his size without issues but smaller dogs and cats are unknown, slow and careful introduction over time is the best way to introduce a new dog to resident pets. Toffee would be best suited to a home with teenagers or adults due to his age, unknown history, and he can be nervous with handling.  For an older pup, he still has lots of pep in his step, so he is ready to be by your side for all sorts of adventures!  Stop by to visit with Toffee today!"

He loves giving kisses and s very affectionate. Donny weighs 60lbs and he adores squeaky toys.  He absolutely loves people so there is a good chance that he will get along with some kids though heâs not been in a home with kids that we know of.  We would suggest not toddlers due to his size and he could knock them over! Donny is very easy going and calm and quiet in the house. Donny prefers a home without cats but he LOVES all types and sizes of people! He is terrific snuggler, has low energy and is very outgoing and social. He is neutered, vaccinated and micro-chipped. Donny was rescued by Greyhound Pets in Woodinville and waiting there to meet you.  His adoption fee is $350 and you can email Kathy at Kkreyling11@yahoo.com with questions and an adoption application.  You will fall in love with this sweetest easy-going boy!"

I am a great watchdog, and am very aware of my surroundings. I will bark at strangers until I get to meet them, and I haven't met a human I didn't like! I am good around other dogs, except intact males, as I was intact myself for the majority of my life. \n\nI have very good manners and would love to meet you and show you what a great addition to your family I would make. \n\nHopefully yours, \nXerxes\""

                        "$t": "* Male Golden Retriever mix\n\n* Approximately 9.5 months old\n\n* Approximately 18 pounds\n\n* House trained on a schedule\n\n* Working on crate training\n\n* Okay with other dogs\n* Okay with cats\n\n* Dog respectful children 12 and older\n\n* Adoption fee: $500\n\nAll dogs with PUP are in private foster homes so we can provide our potential adopters the most current information available.\n\nRaising a puppy requires a lot of work and is a commitment! Donut will be an awesome addition to a family that can give him the attention, exercise, training and affection he deserves.\n\nDue to the fact that this is a mixed breed puppy, we, nor our vets, cannot guarantee the size that your dog will be.\n\nHealth: Donut has been neutered and microchipped. He is current on his DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies. He has been wormed, flea treated and tested negative for heartworm.\n\nHistory: Donut comes from an overcrowded shelter in California. PUP was asked to help and we are so glad we did. All dogs PUP pulls from California come with health certificates, as required by Washington state.\n\nNotes from Donut's Foster Home:\n\nDonut is the sweetest and gentlest dog you will come across. He takes a bit of time to really open up and trust people, but just asks for your patience as he gets over his apprehension. Once he learns that a person is caring and wonât do any harm, his kind and loyal personality comes out full swing. He loves to lay by your side and give kisses. He is still warming up to full on cuddles, but loves attention and will slowly crawl in your lap with each ear scratch given. Donut is medium energy, gets along great with cats and dogs, big or small, and loves to play with them. He goes in his crate with some persuasion, and will be quiet if the household is the same way. At night heâll whine a bit, but will settle down and sleep through the night. He has a healthy appetite but likes his space during meals as he takes his time to finish each one. He is potty trained on a schedule, seeming to do best in a yard where he can have plenty of room to do his business off leash. He loves outings and will walk with ease and little sound, but can be shy to meet new people even if they have a treat.\n\nAlthough still shy and skittish, Donut has made amazing progress. He needs a patient owner to help him work his through his fear of quick movements, loud noises etc. He will thrive in a relatively quiet household, dedicated to continued training, very patient, and full of love to help him soar. Continued training and exposure to a variety of situations, other animals, and new people with be important. Any adopter who is experience in helping fearful pups gain confidence and become well balanced adult dogs will be rewarded with a very faithful, loving companion!\n\nNote: The above description reflects the behavior we have observed in the dog's foster home. Although PUP provides adopters up to the minute information on our dogs, we cannot guarantee they will behave in the same manner in a different environment with new owners.\n\nADOPTION: If you think you have room in your home and heart for this dog and you reside within Washington State, please go to our Adoption Information page, or copy and paste this link https://www.pupdogrescue.org/adopt.html in your browser. There you will find more information and be able to fill out an adoption application.\n\nEVENTS: To attend our next PUP adoption event, please check out our Facebook page, or copy and paste this link https://www.facebook.com/pg/puprescue/events/?ref=page_internal in your browser.\n\nCan you help save more dogs by Fostering?\nBecome our fan on Facebook!

                        "$t": "We currently have a 1 year old Golden Retriever looking for a forever home. Please read the bio below in its entirety because Boo is not your typical golden retriever. Because he is being fostered in Salem, priority will be given to adopters in that area.\n\nBoo likes dogs, but needs to be with dogs that do not guard food/toys/people, and no dogs that are quick to start fights or escalate if another dog starts a fight with them. Boo loves to play fetch and he really likes to carry around his toys (no tennis balls). Boo is a very smart boy and is very trainable, he responds best to reward based training with treats and praise. Due to his history, absolutely no shock collars, prong/choke collars, punishment or fear based training. At heart Boo is a really gentle guy that needs his confidence built and a solid human to let him know everything is going to be alright. He is still a big puppy and does zoomies. He is a talker and will let you know when you have visitors, but he will quickly learn who the neighbors are. He will also let you know if his ball is trapped and he needs a hand. This goofy guy is looking for a family that can understand his needs and in return he will shower you with unconditional love.\n\nMore from his foster home:\n\n-no resource guarding dogs in the home\n-no dogs that escalate (if challenged they will counter attack) and stay engaged\n-he would like a dog friend to play with, but ideal dog would be one that is not interested in fighting, I call dogs like this tolerant and averting. \n-he must have chews and balls (but NO tennis balls, he eats the fuzz and bad for teeth) or he will go for rocks (He is a little anxious and this is how he has learned to self-sooth)\n-he is on Golden Retriever 15 months Royal Canin kibble and I give lots of meaty bones. He also needs krill oil, this has helped his coat A LOT.\n-he loves to play fetch and I play with him everyday, at least 20 mins before dinner.\n-he also needs space to open run\n-he is not a dog park candidate because of his resource guarding and his propensity to escalate a fight. \n-he needs confidence building and will crumble under aversive/compulsive training - no punishment, no shock collars, no yelling/scolding\n-he has shown that he does very well with reward based training, he is very smart and very trainable \n-he wants to be close to his people, he sleeps in the bedroom, but prefers to sleep on his own bed, unless cuddling, he loves to cuddle and get pets\n-for grooming, he is good for toe nail trims, does not have dews front/back, he does have big floppy ears that need regular cleaning, I use wipes\n-he is potty trained, but has access to a dog door and uses it\n-he is not a water dog, but not something I've worked with or care about\n-I suggest the new owner continues to check his thyroid levels yearly\n-he needs an incisor removed, but not an emergency and it doesn't seem to be causing pain\n-he lives with cats, my cats are very dog savvy, if there is a scaredy cat he will probably chase it, he LOVES kitty poop, litter box must not be accessible \n-new owners might want to follow-up with a behavior savvy vet or a veterinary behaviorist (I'm happy to forward on my notes)\n-I think he would really like a dog sport like nose work, rally or agility. \n-lastly, no young children\n-he is not a candidate for a companion dog, emotional support dog or a service dog. He needs a very stable person. If his person is anxious or has emotional instability it will make his issues worse.\nIf, after reading this bio, you are interested in Boo, you can fill out an application at www.spdrdogs.org."

He loves giving kisses and s very affectionate. Donny weighs 60lbs and he adores squeaky toys.  He absolutely loves people so there is a good chance that he will get along with some kids though heâs not been in a home with kids that we know of.  We would suggest not toddlers due to his size and he could knock them over! Donny is very easy going and calm and quiet in the house. Donny prefers a home without cats but he LOVES all types and sizes of people! He is terrific snuggler, has low energy and is very outgoing and social. Donny was rescued by Greyhound Pets in Woodinville and waiting there to meet you.  His adoption fee is $350 and you can email Kathy at Kkreyling11@yahoo.com with questions and an adoption application.  You will fall in love with this sweetest easy-going boy!\n\n"

I am a very happy, affectionate and friendly dog who was just saved from being SOLD to the Dog Meat Dealer to be butchered up for food. I was fed garbage and rotten food and I was supposed to be made into soju elixer. Sadly my mom went to the meat market and it was too late to save her. Korea is so overloaded with dogs roaming all over the streets with no food, love or care and many have been tied up since birth. I am so lucky to get a one way ticket to come to Seattle to find a new forever home! Take me on car rides, walks in the park and I will become your very best friend. I get along well with people of all ages, gentle kids and other dogs. I need a home with a fenced in yard and will do best with a loving family that can give me lots of exercise, love and affection! On all overseas adoptions our pet rescue dog trainer will be required to come to your home and help train with your new puppy for only $ 65. My adoption fee of $1450. Will cover my Spay, DA2PP shots, Rabies, Bordetella, Deworm, Heart Worm Test, Grooming, Microchip, Boarding Fees, Health Certificate, and AIRLINE TRANSPORT COST from KOREA to SEATTLE. The adoption fee is firm and helps cover the medical expenses of our other rescue dogs in need of orthopedic surgery, urgent vet care, dental and teeth extractions, cherry eye removals and more. Donations are always appreciated to help us pay down our vet bills at Greenwood Vet. Ginger's Pet Rescue is a non profit 501 C 3 organization\n"

When their owner passed the dogs were left and Moe scrounged food for his friend, making sure he got to eat daily.  As a result Moe cannot live with any small animals, cats, chickens, etc.\n\nMoe is a very affectionate boy who loves people but needs another dog to forge a deep bond with.  He loves to run around the yard and would do best outside of the city with acreage to run around in.\n\nHe is neutered, UTD on his shots and micro-chipped.  HIs adoption fee is $550."

He enjoys getting puppy massages especially on his head and behind his ears.  He plays well with other dogs but would love to be the center of attention at his forever home. \n\nRonniewasnât always so lucky.  He was abandoned and left by his previous owners because he had a large tumor on his lower jaw.  He sometimes feels unsure about getting out of the car, we think that he relates it to being abandoned. \n\nLuckily Happy Tails Happy Homes discovered Ronnie!  He has been through a lot in the last few weeks, he had surgery that removed half of his lower jaw making him tumor free!  He discovered toys and loves to play.  He had to be shaved to get all the fox tail thorns out of his skin.  And he learned to trust humans again!  \n\nHe is adapting well to eating and drinking water.  Currently we still feed him soft food but he will be ready to eat hard food soon.   He hasnât been around children so we are not sure how he would be with them.  \n\nWe think he would be happiest with someone who is very active, loving and will take him on lots of adventures!"

We have absolutely no clue what he could be but he is awesome, we do know that. Ralph was pulled from San Bernadino Animal Shelter about 45 minutes before he was due to be euthanized. He is super friendly, loves to give kisses and get pets. He is great with dogs of all sizes, and all energy levels. He does well with kids and babies, loves to give them kisses. He is crate trained and has never gone potty in his crate before. This guy is totally the bees knees and has everything you need for an awesome family pet.\n\nAdoption Fee: $375\n\nLink to appliation: https://us12.sheltermanager.com/service?account=am1735&method=online_form_html&formid=40"

                        "$t": "Hello - my name is Bailey.. I am a timid 1 year -old mixed breed pup who looks like I am golden retriever/shepherd mix. I was found in a dumpster in the Middle East at such a young age that my eyes were still closed. Luckily they had a nursing mom at the shelter I was taken to. My surrogate mom took good care of me and fed me until I was strong enough to be on my own. After that I began paying it forward by being motherly to other puppies at the shelter.\n\nNow I have arrived in Canada where everything is different, my timid nature is very evident.  All this change and turmoil has left me nervous and afraid to go outside, especially when it is dark.   I hope you can understand what a challenge it is for me to be surrounded by all these new sights, sounds, smells. Even the kind words that people say to me sound unfamiliar. \n\nI long to find a patient, loving person to give me a forever home where I am the only dog in the house so that I can feel secure.\n\nI know that I will gain confidence over time and it would be so helpful for me to live with someone who appreciates my need to have a calm, routine life while I learn that I am safe. Inside of me there is a free-spirited, happy young dog just waiting to be discovered when I find my perfect place in this world.\n\nCould you be the one to help me find my happy place?\n\nI am spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. My adoption fee is $550.00.\n\nPlease review our adoption guidelines at http://www.lovedatlastdogrescue.ca.\n\nDisclaimer: in order to keep both dogs and children safe, the Board of Directors has decided that unless a representative of LALDR has personally met the dog or has been satisfied by the international rescue about the dogs' ability to live with children, we will not approve an adoption to a family with children age 8 or younger. We are hesitant to approve and adoption for families with children under the age of 12, but will consider each application individually.\n\n***Vaccinations: Dogs from the middle east are vaccinated for rabies, parvo, distemper and leptospirosis. They are not given bordatella as that has not been a problem in the middle east."

                        "$t": "Hello, my name is Spicey and I am longing to come to Canada to live in a real home with you. I am a sweet-natured female Golden Retriever mix, a little over a year old and weighing in at 44lb.\n\n \n\nAt one point in my young life I was a family pet and life was good. But I became ill with distemper and my heartless family kicked me out to fend for myself on the streets.  Wandering, sick and alone in a Middle Eastern city was a dangerous and frightening experience and one that I am lucky to have survived.   A good samaritan found me and paid for me to be treated at a veterinary clinic.\n\n \n\nUnfortunately, when I got distemper I lost my ability to walk. Through the support of my rescuer paying for my rehab and boarding, slowly my legs are getting stronger and I am beginning to walk again. Now as things are, she is worried she will not be able to pay for my boarding anymore. Rather than having the scary thought of sending me to a shelter where I can get bullied by other dogs, she wants me to find a good home in Canada and I think it sounds like a great idea! \n\nAt the moment I am only able to walk a few steps, but I have a strong will and I know that I will one day be able to run again. In the meantime I still love to play with the other dogs and get scratches and belly rubs from everyone I can. \n\n Because of my current weakness, I need a loving family who will be patient with me in my journey to recovery. In order to get stronger I need people to support me and take me to rehab. If I stay here my recovery will be slow because nobody had the time or the means to help me get better.\n\nIf you are out there, please give me a chance to become the healthy, happy dog companion that we both deserve. I would be fine sharing your home with cats or dogs. When it comes to children, I am not very familiar with them, so an adult only home would probably be best.\n\nI can tell you have a big heart. Please look into my eyes and you will see that I do too. Please bring me into your life so we can start filling those hearts with love and happiness.\n\n \n\nI have been spayed/neutered, vaccinated & micro-chipped. \n\nMy adoption fee is $350.00, this includes my airfare to Canada.\n\nPlease review our adoption guidelines at http://www.lovedatlastdogrescue.ca.\n\nDisclaimer: in order to keep both dogs and children safe, the Board of Directors has decided that unless a representative of LALDR has personally met the dog or has been satisfied by the international rescue about the dogs' ability to live with children, we will not approve an adoption to a family with children age 8 or younger. We are hesitant to approve and adoption for families with children under the age of 12, but will consider each application individually.\n\n***Vaccinations: Dogs from the Middle East are vaccinated for rabies, parvo, distemper and leptospirosis. They are not given bordatella as that has not been a problem the Middle East.\n\nMid E/Fariba/Rooby/Spice"

                        "$t": "Let me light up your world. The name is Rainbow, ready to make your life bright, lively and colorful. I am a happy and affectionate Golden Retriever mixed with perhaps a Middle Eastern Village Dog. A mere year and one half old little boy, am I. I am young yet, so still have a bit of growing to do. Which means I will be a large dog, but I will always act like a small one, trying to cuddle up in your lap no doubt. Of course, at about 75 lbs and 23 1/2 inches tall, I may hang off. Both me and my sister, Hunnybun (also listed) are currently living in the Middle East, but we are very excited to one day come to Canada.\n\nOur story started when we are only 3 months old. Both my sister and I became very sick with Parvo and scabies. We would not have made it if it were not for a very kind, dog-loving angel who found us. They paid for our medical bills and nursed up back to health. She loves the beautiful dogs we are growing up to be. Unfortunately, due to the economic situation here, they are having financial trouble caring for us. With their blessing and a bit of luck, we hope to find amazing homes with families that love us.\n\nI may at first seem shy and a bit timid, but once you start showering me with affection, I will become your best friend. Lovable describes me well. I love playing with other dogs and people are pretty great too, especially when they give me those awesome belly scratches. As a spry young dog, I have lots of energy to burn and things to learn! With genes like mine, teaching things will not be hard. I would love to impress people one day with all my tricks. My favourite way to get exercise is running around in the back yard and wrestling with some of my canine buddies.\n\nHaving a dog buddy in the home would be really nice. It would be even better if it was my sister Hunnybun, but we do not have to go to a home together. With youth on my side, I need a place where I can stretch my legs and run around - so maybe take me to the lake or to a dog park to explore and make friends. Though I love people and other dogs, I have never met these strange creatures called cats before. Nor have I been around any kids for that matter, so it would be best if it was a doggie home. Even though I spend my time running around, I still love time to cuddle up under a blanket or curl up by your feet while you watch a movie. My kindhearted nature makes me ache to belong to a loving home of my own. I want more than anything to discover how wonderful the life for a dog can be alongside people I can call my family.\n\nI have been spayed/neutered, vaccinated & micro-chipped.\n\nMy adoption fee is $550.00, this includes my airfare to Canada.\n\nPlease review our adoption guidelines at http://www.lovedatlastdogrescue.ca.\n\nDisclaimer: in order to keep both dogs and children safe, the Board of Directors has decided that unless a representative of LALDR has personally met the dog or has been satisfied by the international rescue about the dogs' ability to live with children, we will not approve an adoption to a family with children age 8 or younger. We are hesitant to approve and adoption for families with children under the age of 12, but will consider each application individually.\n\n***Vaccinations: Dogs from the Middle East are vaccinated for rabies, parvo, distemper and leptospirosis. They are not given bordatella as that has not been a problem the Middle East.\n\nME/Fariba/Spencer/Zeplin/Boomer/Rainbow"

                        "$t": "Please let me be your HunnyBun. I am such a loving girl and I long for a family to love.\n\nI am a 1-1/2 year old female Golden Retriever/Middle Eastern Village dog mix and I weigh 65lb and am around 21\" tall.\n\nMy brother, Rainbow, and I were found on the streets here in the Middle East when we were just 3 months old. We were extremely sick with scabies and life-threatening Parvo virus. Thankfully a compassionate dog-lover took us in and paid for veterinary treatment. She saved our lives. We are still living with our rescuer, but every day it gets more difficult for her to keep us and she is trying hard to find us safe, loving homes in Canada.\n\nIf I could meet you today, after a few moments of shyness, I would show you just what a loving girl I can be. I have so much gratitude inside of me and I would show it in my endless kisses and exhuberant tail wags. \n\nI will happily play with other dogs and could easily share my home with one. Hey, here's a thought, how about my brother; he just happens to be looking for a home too, and he's almost as cute as I am!  But, if you just want to bring me home, that's fine too. I will love you enough for both of us. And I will be just as sweet with other people you introduce me to, once I get over my initial shyness. \n\nWhat would be absolutely wonderful would be a home with people who enjoyed going for walks or letting me run around a dog park to burn off some energy. I think I am naturally a fairly energetic girl, though the life I lead here sadly doesn't allow me to explore that side of my nature very much.  In fact I know I have so much more to discover about life and I am just longing to learn and explore and love.  \n\nYou are out there somewhere, I can feel it. Please bring me home to you soon.\n\nI am spayed, *vaccinated and micro-chipped.\n\nMy adoption fee is $550 CAD, this includes my airfare to Canada.\n\nPlease see our adoption guidelines at www.lovedatlastdgrescue.ca\n\nDisclaimer: In order to protect both dogs and children the Board of Directors has decided that unless a representatie of  LALDR  has personally met the dog, or has been satisfied by the international rescue of the dogs' ability to live with children, we will not approve a family for adoption. Specifically, we will not approve and adoption to a family with children age 8 or younger. We are hesitant to approve an adoption to a family with children under the age of 12 years, but will consider each application individually.\n\n*Vaccinations: Dogs from the Middle East are vaccinated for rabies, parvo, distemper and leptospirosis. They are not given bordatella as this has not been a problem in this country.\n"

                        "$t": "Hi, my name is Sandy and I am a gentle female Golden Retriever mix in my senior years. It is thought that I am approximately 13 years old.\n\nMy loving owner must move by November 30th and despite extensive searching he has been unable to find somewhere he can bring a large dog like me. My future is uncertain and I need your help.\n\nI have been living here for the past 9 years after my owner found me wandering alone on a logging road. This home has been good for me and I am worried about leaving here and finding someone who will understand I can be anxious about strange things. For example, I will only walk through a door if it is fully open wide. \n\nOn the other hand, I am very tolerant of most things. Although I love my food, I will just walk away from it if the other dog in the household decides he wants it; life's too short to let things like that bother me.  I ignore the resident cat and I will just get up and move if the 2 year old grandson decides to climb on me.  So, you see, I am really no trouble. \n\nI have to confess that I have not seen a vet in the past 5 years, but I manage just fine on my two walks a day. I may not be fast, but I get there in the end!\n\nDo you think you could give a sweet old gal like me a comfortable home to spend my retirement?  I really hope so, because time is running out. \n\n \n\n \n\nI am local and my adoption fee is $300 CAD.\n\nPlease review our adoption guidelines at http://www.lovedatlastdogrescue.ca"

                        "$t": "Hi, my name is Grasshopper in light of the way my legs bend. I am a male golden retriever, 3 years of age, 33lb and 23 inches tall and I am in Bahrain. \n\nA little over a year ago a kind American lady found me lying by the side of the road with both my front legs broken in multiple places. I was taken to a veterinary clinic and examined. The vet said my bones had likely been deliberately broken with some kind of metal object. Although I can not recall exactly what happened I do tend to react fearfully to some people, who perhaps remind me of my attacker. \n\nI spent around 3 months at the vet clinic, during which time it was determined that it was best not to amputate my legs because I can still use them to get around, if somewhat unconventionally. The bones have healed into this shape now and I am not in any pain. \n\nWhen I first meet new people I am fearful and it takes me around 10 to 15 minutes to warm up to them. After that though, I can be very friendly and sweet. I will need a home with someone who understands I need careful introductions to strangers. \n\nWhile I enjoy being around other dogs, one animal that quickly brings out the loving side of me is a cat. While I have been living at this shelter I have come to know several cats and I always eat and sleep with them. Somehow they bring me comfort, and perhaps I do the same for them.\n\nI would love to find a home with someone calm and patient who can see the love inside me. We could take gentle walks together and you can help me build my confidence in new situations.  If that home included one or more kitties, I would be over the moon. \n\n \n\nI am neutered, vaccinated and microchipped and my adoption fee of $450 CAD includes my airfare to Canada.\n\nPlease review our adoption guidelines at http://www.lovedatlastdogrescue.ca\n\nDisclaimer: In order to protect both dogs and children, the Board of Directors has decided that unless a representative of LALDR has personally met the dog, or has been satisfied by the international rescue of the dogs' ability to live with children, we will not approve a family for adoption. Specifically, we will not approve an adoption to a family with children age 8 or younger. We are hesitant to approve an adoption to a family with children under the age of 12, but will consider each application individually."

                        "$t": "Hello, my name is Jolie and I am a sweet-natured female golden retriever from Bahrain. I am 3 years old, 23 inches tall and I weigh 44lb.\n\nI was found after being hit by a car when I was wandering the city streets as a stray. The kind people that found me took me to the vet where it was determined that my leg needed to be amputated. Being a tri-pod is not such a big deal for us dogs, so please don't let that deter you from bringing me home with you.\n\nSince coming to this shelter I have fallen in love with a handsome hunk named Nino (also available for adoption here) and the two of us share a kennel. I adore him and he seems to feel the same way about me. Not to be boastful, but I do think we make a very good-looking pair. I know it is unlikely that we will find a home together, but that's alright because I get along with all dogs. \n\nOne of my greatest joys is getting attention from humans so if you want an affectionate dog, I'm your girl. I also really enjoy my food so you could probably teach me just about anything if it involves treats. \n\nI would love to come and live with you and your family and if you already have another dog, that's fine with me. I haven't been cat tested so I can't predict how I would behave with them. \n\nUntil you send for me I will be spending my days following my handsome 'husband' around, just like a lovesick puppy.\n\n \n\nI am spayed, vaccinated and microchipped and my adoption fee of $450 CAD includes my airfare to Canada.\n\nPlease review our adoption guidelines at http://www/lovedatlastdogrescue.ca\n\nDisclaimer: In order to protect both dogs and children, the Board of Directors has decided that unless a representative of LALDR has personally met the dog, or has been satisfied by the international rescue of the dogs' ability to live with children, we will not approve a family for adoption. Specifically, we will not approve an adoption to a family with children age 8 or younger. We are hesitant to approve an adoption to a family with children under the age of 12, but will consider each application individually"

                        "$t": "Hello dear people of Canada, my name is Elvis. I am a handsome, golden-coloured, 1-1/2 year old, male Anatolian and maybe Greyhound mix. Weighing in at 75 lbs and 21 inches tall, I am a large boy. Though my ears were cruelly cut off, I am hoping that you will instead focus on the great affection and love I offer. Are you lonesome tonight... cause I can't help, falling in love with you. I will love you tender and love you true.\n\nIn my short life, I have already known more than my fair share of cruelty, hunger, fear and harsh conditions. Sadly, this is the life of a middle eastern stray dog and it's the life I was born into. I took comfort in the company of my mother, Patti, who taught me where to scavenge for food and which humans to avoid. Together we discovered that there can be kind humans in the world too. We were offered food in a neighbourhood that we had visited before. A wonderful lady befriended us and started feeding us regularly and showing affection towards us. I couldn't get enough of her company and would follow her wherever she went. I wanted to be with her all the time and I tried so hard to show her my love and loyalty.\n\nIt broke my heart when she had to leave, but she promised me she would try to save me from this hard and lonely street life. She kept her promise and here I am. Niw, I am hoping that someone will read about me and know in their heart that I am the dog for them.\n\nI absolutely love humans and am a super great cuddler and hugger. My deep love brings a need for possessiveness however. Thus, I show signs of jealousy to other dogs wanting to share affections. I am quite alpha acting that way and will become quite assertive against another dog (primarily a male or another dominant) trying to share your attentions. Cats are not a good idea either, as I have been known to chase them.\n\nI would be best suited to a home as an only dog or perhaps a home with a submissive female. I do like to socialize with the girls. I will need additional leash training for impulse control/self correction towards other dogs on walks. Although I do not enjoy getting into the car for rides, once in, I will tolerate it. Getting me to focus on a job, whether that is doing a dog sport or some special tasks would be the key. A large fenced yard would be ideal. Don't be cruel to a heart that's true, I just want all the love to myself. If you are dog savvy, then you are just the person I need. When you need someone to turn to, let me be the one.\n\nI have been spayed/neutered, *vaccinated & micro-chipped.\n\nMy adoption fee is $500.00 CAD, this includes my airfare to Canada. Sterilization is required. My spay/neuter is mandatory for my adoption to be finalized.\n\nPlease review our adoption guidelines at http://www.lovedatlastdogrescue.ca.\n\nDisclaimer: in order to keep both dogs and children safe, the Board of Directors has decided that unless a representative of LALDR has personally met the dog or has been satisfied by the international rescue about the dogs' ability to live with children, we will not approve an adoption to a family with children age 8 or younger. We are hesitant to approve and adoption for families with children under the age of 12, but will consider each application individually.\n \n*Vaccinations: Dogs from the Middle East are vaccinated for rabies, parvo, distemper and leptospirosis. They are not given bordatella as that has not been a problem the Middle East."

                        "$t": "Hello there, please allow me to introduce myself: my name is Kangaroo and I am a friendly 10 month-old femaleÂ puppy who looks like a mix of golden retriever and husky.Â \n\nYou will notice in my pictures that I am lacking front legs. Please don't pity me; I was born like this, so for me it is completely normal and not at all painful to spend most of my time sitting, like a little bear, in a very erect posture.\n\nMy rescuer found me on the streets in the middle eastÂ and brought me to a kind-hearted dog-lover to care for. I would surely not have survived otherwise. Life in the middle eastÂ is very hard for all dogs, let alone those of us who have disabilities, so although I am safe now, there is not much of a future for me in this country.\n\nI am a very friendly girl and I love other dogs, cats and people. I have heard such wonderful things about life in Canada and I dream of finding a home there where I could be provided with the means to move around. If I were to be adopted LALDR would provide wheels for me so I could have a taste of the kind of puppy life that I have missed so far.\n\nRecently I have been lucky enough to be taken in by an amazing foster family and they have only great things to tell about me. I have only been with them a week and a half and have adjusted very well to my temporary home. I am crate trained and even became potty trained in two days, can you believe how smart I am! I discovered a new friend in their resident dog and my foster parents give me a gold star when I am with people or other dogs.\n\nThey have given me some wheels to try out, but because I am so accustomedÂ to the way I am, its a bit weird for me. The good news is, I will hopefully be fitted for a prosthetic leg in January! They found that I can get on sofas and stairs just fine, but I may need a hand when it comes to getting back down those pesky stairs and getting in and out of cars. So be aware you may have to help pick my cute butt off the ground sometimes. Other than that, they say I am a quiet dog, I will let you know if there are visitors though so you can consider me as your new doorbell.\n\nOf course the best kind of home for me would be one without a lot of different levels orÂ stairs, but the most important gift anyone could give me would be the understanding that while I may have physical limitations, my ability to love life has no limits whatsoever!\n\nI am spayed, vaccinated and microchipped and my adoption fee of $350 includes my airfare to Canada.Â \n\nPlease review our adoption guidelines at http://www.lovedatlastdogrescue.ca\n\nDisclaimer: In order to keep both dogs and children safe, the Board of Directors has decided that unless a representative of LALDR has personally met the dog, or has been satisfied by the international rescue of the dogs' ability to live with children, we will not approve a family for adoption. Specifically, we will not approve an adoption to a family with children age 8 or younger. We are hesitant to approve an adoption for families with children under the age of 12 years, but will consider each application individually.\n\nVaccinations: Dogs in the middle eastÂ are vaccinated for rabies, parvo, distemper and leptospirosis. They are not given bordatella as this has not been a problem in middle east."
